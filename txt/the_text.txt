However, we find that the current PPL cannot fairly evaluate the text quality (i.e., fluency) when meeting the following scenarios. (i) The texts to be evaluated have different lengths (Meister and Cotterell, 2021b). In fact, text quality is not strictly related to length. However, we find that the PPL is sensitive to text length, e.g., the PPL of short text is larger than long text. (ii) The texts to be evaluated have some repeated span(s). Of course, sometimes creators use repeated text span(s) to express emphasis et al.. However, PPL cannot distinguish between the right emphasis and abnormal repetition, and always foolishly assigns lower scores to text that is not fluent but has repeated spans. (iii) The texts to be evaluated are sensitive to punctuation marks. For example, we have two texts, the former ends with punctuation, and the latter deletes the last punctuation. In theory, the qualified metric should compute the same or similar value. However, there is a significant difference between the PPL values of those two texts.
