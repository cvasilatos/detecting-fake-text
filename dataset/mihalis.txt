Set 1:
Given the following assumptions: Host IP address 135.168.1.50, Host MAC address 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be, Host Name myhost.mysubnet.com, Netmask 255.255.255.0 or /24, Router IP address/Default gateway 135.168.1.1, and DNS IP address 8.8.8.8, explain in detail in the report every step that is taken to initiate a connection with www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com. Specify each protocol used and why. Assume there is no cached information for this question. Please answer the following questions:

Question 1: What is the difference between a host name and a host IP address? How is each utilized during this process?

Student1:
In order to initiate a connection with www.cyberwarefarenyuad.com, the host machine undergoes a series
of steps. When this URL is typed into the browser, the browser intends to communicate with the server.
To do that, it first extracts the hostname from said URL. In this case, the hostname is
‘myhost.subnet.com’. The browser then looks up the IP address for this hostname, which is done through
a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup, giving us the IP 192.168.1.50 for this URL. Host
names are labels that are assigned to computers to identify them on the network. It is essential to
differentiate different devices from each other and is used to send the user to a particular webpage. On the
other hand, a host IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device

Student2:
Host name or otherwise called domain name is utilised when a web client sends an HTTP request to a host, Host names are used rather than IP address as they are easier to be remembered. However, host names are mapped to IP addresses, but a host name and an IP address do not have a one-to-one relationship as services in the name of one host can be provided by many servers, which have different IP addresses.


Student3:
Whenever a user tries to access a website - he types its address in the browser, as in gmail.com or wikipedia.org. But, on
the internet, the IP addresses are the ones that are actually being used. Host IP addresses are essentially the IP addresses
translated into words, they enable the users to easily access the website without the need of typing in the actual IP address
every time. The browser does that translation internally, using the domain name system (DNS). We can think of DNS
servers as routers that send packages of information or a dictionary that links hostnames to the IP addresses. DNS servers
respond to questions from clients (users). Clients give the website name (the hostname) and DNS finds a corresponding IP
address for that website. So the first step in connecting to www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com would be the retrieval of the IP
address from the DNS.

GPT 1:
A host name is a human-readable label that is assigned to a device, such as a computer or a router, on a network. It is used to identify the device on the network and is typically composed of a series of alphanumeric characters separated by periods, such as "myhost.mysubnet.com".

A host IP address, on the other hand, is a numerical label assigned to a device on a network. It is used to identify and locate the device on the network, and is typically represented in the form of four octets separated by periods, such as "135.168.1.50".

In the process of initiating a connection with www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com, the host name is first utilized by the client device to initiate a DNS (Domain Name System) query. The DNS is a distributed database that maps domain names to IP addresses. The client device sends a request to the DNS server specified in its network configuration (8.8.8.8) to resolve the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" to its corresponding IP address. Once the IP address is received, the client device can then utilize the host IP address to initiate a connection with the target website.

In summary, host names are used to identify devices on a network in a human-readable format, while host IP addresses are used to identify and locate devices on a network in a numerical format. The host name is used to initiate a DNS query to resolve the domain name to IP address, once the IP address is received the host IP address is used to initiate the connection.

GPT 2:
A host name is a human-readable string that identifies a device on a network. It is typically used to make it easier for users to remember the address of a device, rather than having to remember its numerical IP address. In this case, the host name is "myhost.mysubnet.com".

A host IP address, on the other hand, is a numerical address assigned to a device on a network. It is used to identify and locate the device on the network, allowing other devices to communicate with it. In this case, the host IP address is 135.168.1.50.

During the process of initiating a connection with www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com, the host name is not used directly. Instead, the host will use its IP address to initiate the connection. However, the host name is used in the process of resolving the domain name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" to an IP address, which is necessary for the host to initiate the connection.

The process of resolving a domain name to an IP address is known as DNS resolution. The host will begin by checking its local cache for a previously resolved IP address for the domain name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com". If there is no cached information, the host will send a DNS query to the DNS server specified by its network configuration, which in this case is 8.8.8.8.

The DNS server will then check its own cache for a previously resolved IP address for the domain name. If it does not find one, it will send a recursive query to other DNS servers on the internet, following the hierarchical structure of the DNS system. These servers will check their own caches and send further queries until the IP address for the domain name is found.

Once the IP address is found, it is returned to the host in the form of a DNS response, along with any additional information such as the Time-To-Live (TTL) value for the IP address. The host will then cache this information for future use.

The following protocols are used in this process:

	User Datagram Protocol (UDP): This protocol is used for the initial DNS query sent by the host to the DNS server. It is used because it is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not require a dedicated connection to be established before data is exchanged. This allows the host to quickly send a query and receive a response without the overhead of establishing a connection.

	Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): This protocol is used for the recursive queries sent by the DNS server to other DNS servers on the internet. It is used because it is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a dedicated connection is established before data is exchanged. This allows for reliable and error-free transmission of the queries and responses.

	Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet. It is used because it provides the necessary addressing information for the packets to reach their destination.

In summary, the host uses UDP to quickly send a DNS query to the DNS server and receive a response. The DNS server uses TCP to send recursive queries to other DNS servers on the internet and receive responses in a reliable manner. IP is used to route the packets through the internet to their destination.

GPT 3:
A host name is a unique name assigned to a device on a network, such as "myhost.mysubnet.com" in this scenario. It is used for human-readable identification and organization of devices on a network. A host IP address, on the other hand, is a numerical label assigned to each device on a network, such as "135.168.1.50" in this scenario. It is used for routing and addressing purposes on the network.

In this process, the host name "myhost.mysubnet.com" is used initially to initiate a connection with the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com." However, the host name needs to be translated into a host IP address in order for the connection to be established. This is where the Domain Name System (DNS) comes into play. The host sends a DNS request to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8, asking for the IP address associated with the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com." Once the DNS server returns the IP address, the host uses it to establish a connection with the website.

In summary, the host name is used for identification and organization, while the host IP address is used for routing and addressing. The host name is initially used to initiate the connection, but it is translated into a host IP address through the use of DNS before the connection can be established.

Question 2: What are MAC addresses and when are they used during the communication?

Student1:
All the devices in your (wireless) network have MAC addresses. MAC stands for Media Access Control, and it identifies
which device is which on your local network. When data arrives at your router, it has to decide where to forward it. The
router keeps track of all the devices’ MAC addresses in your network. It then assigns a private IP address to a device
(which usually starts with 192.168). This IP address is different from the public IP address of your entire network that
everyone on the internet sees. The router attaches a private IP address to the data packets that you receive from the
internet in order to ensure proper delivery to your device. Even though public and private IP addresses stay the same, the
MAC addresses on data packets are constantly being changed. The packets tell the data where it’s supposed to go next.
Once the data reaches the next device, the MAC address changes once again in order to it to tell where it’s going next.
Many devices have MAC addresses hard-coded in their firmware (i.e they stay the same). This is helpful when for
instance one needs to spot a malfunctioning device, as they can locate it using the MAC address. Another way to use
MAC addresses is to list devices that you approve to connect to your network. In this way, even if one were to steal your
WiFi password, or even connect to your network physically, they wouldn’t be able to utilize it, since only the devices
having the approved MAC addresses can do so. ISPs also use MAC addresses to identify the devices that they provide
with the internet connection, and they can also use them to block the connection.
The browser keeps track of outbound requests so when one clicks a link online, it sends the data to the router, and attaches
the correct private IP address to the data packets sent, ensuring that they arrive at the correct destination. All the private
IPs correspond to their MAC addresses, and the computer needs both

Student2:
A MAC address or (media access control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a (NIC) network interface controller for use as a network address to uniquely identify a device on the network. MAC is also essential component required for network protocols like TCP/IP to function which is the most optimal protocol used in this case as TCP/IP protocol makes sure that the packages have reached the destination.
All devices communicate only through MAC, when the computer wants to establish a connection with www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com, The PC finds the IP of the website (8.8.8.8)  then checks the local routing table, and finds the router to send the request, in this case ( the router with IP 192.168.1.1). The PC puts the IP (8.8.8.8)  as the destination in the packet and sends it to the router. It finds the Mac of the gateway using ARP (address resolution protocol) and sends the packet to the switch it is connected to, which then checks the routing table with MAC ID’s which indicates the port via which the packet has to be forwarded based on the destination MAC.
To send this data packet to the destination, switches have a routing table which they make by learning MAC from ARP and sending BPDU ( Bridge protocol data unit ) between neighbouring switches. Hence the packet reaches the gateway, which does the same thing to route the packet to next hop using its MAC.


Student3:
Every device in a particular network
also has its own unique Media Access Control address that helps in the establishment of physical
connections between devices within a particular network and it provides physical identifiers of a
particular device. MAC addresses are 48-bit addresses (in this example, the MAC address is
8a:00:12:3e:d6:eb) and it remains unique, while IP addresses are recycled as and when devices connect
and disconnect. When a data package for a device in the LAN arrives at the default gateway (in this
case, 192.168.1.1), an Address Resolution Protocol matches the IP address with a MAC address. In this
way, MAC addresses help in communication.

GPT 1:
MAC addresses, or Media Access Control addresses, are unique identifiers assigned to each device on a network. They are used to identify devices on the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model.

During the communication process, MAC addresses are used when the host (with the MAC address 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be) initiates a connection with the router (default gateway) which is assigned with a different MAC address. The host sends an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to the router, asking for the router's MAC address. The router then responds with its MAC address, which the host uses to establish a connection with the router.

Once the host is connected to the router, the router uses the host's MAC address to forward the data packets to the host. The router also uses the host's MAC address to keep track of the host's location on the network, and to ensure that the data packets are only sent to the correct device.

Therefore, MAC addresses are used at the beginning of the communication process to establish a connection with the router and then throughout the communication process to forward data packets and keep track of the host's location on the network.

GPT 2:
MAC (Media Access Control) addresses are unique, physical addresses assigned to network devices, such as the host device in this scenario with a MAC address of 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be. They are used to identify and address devices on a local area network (LAN).

During the communication process, MAC addresses are used when the host device sends a request to the router (default gateway) to establish a connection with the website. The host device sends an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to the router to determine its MAC address, as it is necessary for the host device to identify the router in order to establish a connection. This ARP request is broadcasted to all devices on the LAN, and the router responds with its MAC address, allowing the host device to establish a connection and send the DNS request.

In summary, MAC addresses are unique physical addresses assigned to network devices and are used to identify and address devices on a local area network. They are used during the communication process when the host device sends an ARP request to the router to determine its MAC address before establishing a connection.

GPT 3:
MAC (Media Access Control) addresses are unique physical addresses assigned to network devices, such as the host's MAC address "8a:00:12:3e:d6:be" in this scenario. They are used to identify and address devices on a local area network (LAN).

MAC addresses are used during the communication process when the host initiates a connection with the router (default gateway) to reach the website. The host sends an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to the router, asking for the MAC address associated with the router's IP address "135.168.1.1." The router then sends an ARP reply with its MAC address, allowing the host to establish a connection with it.

In summary, MAC addresses are unique physical addresses assigned to network devices, used to identify and address devices on a LAN. They are used during the communication process when the host initiates a connection with the router, through the use of the ARP protocol.

Question 3: How does the communication request travel from the client to the server side? Which port numbers are used during this operation and how are they utilized?

Student1:
The ARP is a component of the next layer – the internetwork layer. This is where the IP addresses play
the most important role, and where the data travels in packets from one address to the next. IP addresses
are very efficient aids to transportation. While the host name shows the user-readable version of the
device’s name, the host IP address gives information on the location to which the data must be routed.
The succeeding layer is the transport layer that serves as an assurance of an effective transportation
system. The protocols that come into play here include TCP and UDP, where the former ensures quality
of the data and the latter ensures that the data gets delivered in real time, although at the slight expense
of high quality. The topmost layer is the Application layer which sends the host device data on the
webpage, email, etc that needs to be accessed. A significant Application layer protocol is the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is the foundation of the World Wide Web. In this example, too, HTTP
plays an important role in accessing www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com.
In the example, the process begins with the user entering the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the
browser from the host device. The URL is a human-readable address that needs to be translated into a
machine-readable IP address so that the webpage can be accessed. The browser retrieves the required
IP address from the Domain Name System (DNS). In this case, the DNS’s IP address is 8.8.8.8, which
corresponds to Google’s DNS (implying that the browser being used is Google). Every application that
uses the Internet to operate receives a port number that facilitates communication. Since the HTTP
protocol is used in this case, the port number is 80, and the web server expects to receive requests from
the client via this port. The browser makes a TCP connection to www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com’s IP
address via port number 80 and communicates information on itself, the requested data and more. This
information is sent via the router that adds its public IP address to the request and sends it as a data
packet to the server.

Student2:
Port 443 as it is the port assigned to commonly used internet communication protocol, HTTPS, or port 80 if the website was not secured (HTTP). It is the default network port used to send and receive unencrypted web pages. This port number is given after the IP address so that the server can identify which service or program the client wants to use.

Student3:
A port is a logical connection that is used by services and programs to exchange information, it determines the specific
program or service that is going to be used. Its values range from 0 to 65535. Some of the common port numbers are 80,
443 - Web pages (HTTP, HTTPS), 21 FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and 25 - email (SMTP). Port numbers are always
associated with an IP address, they work together to exchange data.
Everything connected directly or indirectly to the internet has an IP address (e.g. computers, phones, servers, etc.) Servers
are computers directly connected to the internet and every internet server has an Internet Protocol (IP) address. Unlike
servers, the computers you and I use are called clients, they are connected indirectly to the internet through an internet
service provider (ISP)

GPT 1:
The communication request travels from the client (the host) to the server side (the website) through a series of steps using various protocols. The process can be broken down into the following steps:

	The host initiates a connection by sending a DNS request to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8, asking for the IP address associated with the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com."

	Once the DNS server returns the IP address, the host uses it to initiate a connection with the router (default gateway) by sending an ARP request to the router's IP address "135.168.1.1," asking for the router's MAC address.

	The router sends an ARP reply with its MAC address, allowing the host to establish a connection with it.

	The host sends an IP packet to the router, containing the destination IP address of the website (the IP address returned by the DNS server) and the destination port number of 80 (HTTP protocol), which is the standard port number used for web communication.

	The router then forwards the packet to the website's server by using routing tables and the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

	The website's server receives the packet and processes the request. It then sends a response back to the host, again using the IP and TCP protocols.

In summary, the communication request travels from the client to the server side through a series of steps using various protocols. The host name is translated into an IP address through the use of DNS, and the host establishes a connection with the router through the use of ARP. The host then sends an IP packet to the router, containing the destination IP address of the website and the destination port number of 80 (HTTP protocol). The router then forwards the packet to the website's server, and the server sends a response back to the host.

GPT 2:
The communication request travels from the client (host) to the server (website) through a series of network layers and protocols. The process can be summarized in the following steps:

	The host initiates a connection with the website by sending an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the website's IP address, obtained through the DNS resolution process.

	The request is sent to the router (default gateway) through the use of the ARP protocol, as previously explained.

	The router uses its routing table to determine the next hop for the request and forwards it to the next network device (such as a switch or another router) or directly to the Internet.

	The request is then sent to the website's server, where it is received by the web server software (such as Apache or Nginx)

	After the web server software receives the request it will then proceed to open a port number and waits for the client (host) to send a request, this is called a port number.

	The web server software processes the request and sends an HTTP response back to the host, which includes the requested webpage or any error message.

The port numbers used during this operation are typically port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. Port numbers are used to identify specific services or applications running on a device and to route the incoming request to the appropriate service or application.

In summary, the communication request travels from the client (host) to the server (website) through a series of network layers and protocols, including the use of the HTTP protocol, the IP routing, and the ARP protocol. Port numbers, such as port 80 and 443, are used to identify specific services or applications running on a device and to route the incoming request to the appropriate service or application.

GPT 3:
When the host initiates a connection with the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com," the communication request travels from the client (host) to the server (website) in the following steps:
	•	The host sends a DNS request to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8, asking for the IP address associated with the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com."
	•	The DNS server returns the IP address associated with the host name, which the host uses to initiate a connection with the website.
	•	The host sends an ARP request to the router, asking for the MAC address associated with the router's IP address "135.168.1.1."
	•	The router sends an ARP reply with its MAC address, allowing the host to establish a connection with it.
	•	The host sends an IP packet to the router, containing the destination IP address of the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com."
	•	The router forwards the IP packet to the website based on the destination IP address.
During this operation, the following port numbers are used:
	•	The host uses port number 53 for the DNS request and DNS response.
	•	The host uses port number 0 for the ARP request and ARP response.
	•	The host uses the transport-layer protocol, such as TCP or UDP, to establish a connection with the website. The ports numbers will be defined by the protocol that is used. For example, if the host uses HTTP(S) protocol, the host will use port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
In summary, the communication request travels from the client to the server by passing through the host, router, and DNS server. The host uses port number 53 for the DNS request and response, port number 0 for the ARP request and response, and the transport-layer protocol to establish a connection with the website. The transport-layer protocol will use the appropriate port number to communicate with the server.

Question 4: How do the contents of the website eventually reach the client?

Student1:
Anywhere two or more parts of the internet intersect, the piece of equipment called a router comes into the game. In
general, a router is a device that connects two different IP networks and acts as a gateway, the hosts from two different
ends can send the traffic through it. Most hosts will have one interface with an IPv4 address, while a router will have two
or more. The host on a local network knows about the default gateway - the router that is connected with the rest of the
internet. Computers attached to the same switch or WiFI access point can easily send data packages to one another
without a need to go through a different network, as they are connected locally. A default gateway may have another
default gateway connected to it, but as we go forward we will reach a point where there is the default less part, where
routers on major transit ISPs know about the global rounding table - the directory of all public IP networks. Those routers
do not have default gateways.

Student2:
The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on (8.8.8.8). Then the browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a message confirming the connection is successful, and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data. The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it.


Student3:
The information is processed by the web server that finally sends a status code to the browser. The
contents of the desired webpage are then sent in the form of data packets that reach the router and
finally, to the host device through ARP. The data packets contain information on assembling the
webpage that are analyzed by the web browser. The packets contain code in HTML, CSS, and more,
and these are processed by the rendering engine of the browser. The user finally sees a complete
webpage.


GPT 1:
Once the host establishes a connection with the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com," the contents of the website eventually reach the client in the following steps:
	•	The host sends a request to the website, using the transport-layer protocol (such as TCP or UDP) and the appropriate port number, asking for the specific web page or resource it wants to access.
	•	The website receives the request and processes it, fetching the requested web page or resource from its server.
	•	The website sends a response to the host, containing the requested web page or resource, along with any associated data or media.
	•	The host receives the response and processes the contents of the web page, displaying it on the client device.
In summary, the contents of the website reach the client by the host sending a request to the website using the transport-layer protocol and the appropriate port number, the website sending a response containing the requested web page or resource, and the host receiving and processing the contents of the web page, displaying it on the client device.

GPT 2:

	•	The host sends an HTTP request to the website, asking for the specific webpage or resource.
	•	The website receives the request and sends an HTTP response, which contains the requested webpage or resource.
	•	The response is sent back to the host in the form of IP packets, containing the requested webpage or resource.
	•	The host receives the IP packets and reassembles them into the requested webpage or resource.
	•	The host displays the contents of the webpage or resource on the client device.
During this operation, the host uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with the website. The HTTP protocol uses port number 80 for unencrypted communication and port number 443 for encrypted communication.
In summary, the contents of the website reach the client through the use of the HTTP protocol, which is used to request and receive the webpage or resource. The requested webpage or resource is sent back to the host in the form of IP packets, which are reassembled and displayed on the client device.
GPT 3:

	•	The host sends a request for the contents of the website, typically using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol.
	•	The request is sent to the website's server, which processes the request and retrieves the requested content from its database.
	•	The server sends a response to the host, which includes the requested content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
	•	The response is received by the host, which uses the information in the response to display the website's contents on the client's web browser.
	•	The host continues to send and receive requests and responses as the client interacts with the website, such as clicking on links or submitting forms.
In summary, the contents of the website reach the client through the process of requesting and receiving information from the website's server using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The host uses the information in the response to display the website's contents on the client's web browser.

Set 2:
Question 5: This question seeks information about today’s cyber-threat landscape. In a few paragraphs, please describe the types of cyber-threats available, and also describe the motivation behind using cyber-attacks instead of physical attacks.

Student1:
Each piece of technology (software or hardware) that people
use can have many vulnerabilities, which, sooner or later, can
be maliciously used to attack individuals, enterprises, or even
governments.
A cyber-attack may consist of multiple steps. A typical cyber-attack consists of:
• Reconnaissance - gathering information and finding vul-
nerabilities in the target computer/network/device.
• Penetration - gaining access.
• Stealing of valuable data or insertion of malware (mali-
cious software) into the target.
• Obfuscation - hiding the traces of the attack.
The first step of almost every cyber attack is gathering some
information. As we use the internet on the daily basis, if
we do not take necessary measures, our sensitive information
becomes exposed to the public and at any point can be used
maliciously against us. For example, many individuals and
even enterprises such as nuclear plants may connect to the
public internet which makes their actions exposed to everyone.
If a person uses an HTTP connection, then his/her connec-
tion will be visible to everyone. Even with HTTPS, there’s a
chance of someone listening to the information. For example,
during the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the attacker spoofs the
certificate and sees the information that is being transferred.
The victim doesn’t see anything suspicious, because the infor-
mation still arrives at the destination.
After finding a technical vulnerability, for example, a zero-
day vulnerability, in some software or hardware, the attackers
can exploit it for getting access. Zero-day vulnerabilities are
vulnerabilities that have recently been discovered and not yet
disclosed or fixed. For example, EternalBlue and EternalRo-
mance vulnerabilities in Windows, after being leaked from
NSA, were used for Trojans such as TrickBot and Emotet.
Also, because of prioritizing profit over security, many
enterprises may use commercial off-the-shelf products instead
of developing their own software/hardware. Because of this, if
vulnerabilities are found in one of those products, the whole
business might be in danger.

Instead of vulnerabilities in software/hardware, the reckless-
ness of the user can be exploited for gaining access to the
target system. For example, the Mirai botnet spread through
thousands of IoT devices all thanks to people having default or
simple passwords that could easily be broken with a dictionary
attack.
For gaining access, social engineering is also used, which
involves the deception and manipulation of the target. In the
case of Stuxnet, there was no way of accessing the nuclear
facilities via the internet, as their networks were isolated.
However, USB devices were used as intermediaries for getting
the worm in the networks. This most likely involved
dropping USB drives in or near the facilities which would then
be picked up by workers and plugged into their computers,
causing them to be infected with Stuxnet.
Social engineering attacks can be defined as
”the manipulation of user-computer inter-
facing with the purpose to breach a computer system’s infor-
mation security through user deception.” These attacks involve
phishing, malvertisement, file or application masquerading,
web pop-ups, and so on. Their goal is to deceive the user
into thinking that what they are opening/downloading is legit.
• Phishing - sending spam emails that trick victims into re-
vealing sensitive information or downloading something.
• File or application masquerading - a file or an application
may appear safe but contain malicious code inside (e.g.
PDF file masquerading).
• Malvertisement - a malicious ad that people think is
legitimate.
• Search engine poisoning - manipulating a search engine
in a way that shows the malicious website among top-
ranked results.
If access to the victim’s computer is gained, malware can
be installed. Malware, defined as malicious software, includes
many types of programs that once installed, can take over
the control of the machine and track the victim’s actions, steal
information, or do something else that will benefit the attacker.
These include:
• Ransomware - the malware that encrypts the files on the
computer and returns them to the victim if a certain sum
of money is paid.
• Information stealers.
• Key-loggers - track what keys the user presses on the
keyboard and sends the data to the attacker.
• Cryptominers - programs that use the victim’s computer’s
computing power for mining cryptocurrencies for the
attacker.
Finally, to conceal malware, different methods are used.
Rootkits can be installed to conceal the program from the
operating system, or other ways can be used (e.g. changing
the process name) for preventing the victim to find out
about the attack.
The compromised computers may also become a part of a
botnet. A botnet is a network of infected computers that can be
instructed to do something. Most commonly, botnets are used
for launching DDoS attacks. A denial of service (DoS) attack
is when many requests are sent to a web server. The server
fails to process them in time, and as new requests come in, it is
unable to respond, which results in people being unable to use
the services provided by the server. A DoS attack originating
from one IP address can be easily blocked by blocking the
address. However, this doesn’t work for DDoS (Distributed
DoS) attacks in which case the requests are coming in from
many different IP addresses. That’s why botnets are perfect
for launching DDoS attacks - it’s hard to tell for the server
whether the bots have malicious intents or not.
DDoS attacks coming from botnets can have a high impact.
The attacks launched by the Mirai botnet were able to shut
down Dyn (a DNS provider) and Valve Steam’s and Playsta-
tion’s servers.
Cyber attacks have some advantages and disadvantages
compared to physical attacks. First of all, if the attacker
seeks destruction and bloodshed, physical attacks will be
more useful. For example,  attacks on critical
infrastructures of the US will most likely not have as high
casualties as weapons of mass destruction will have.
However, cyber attacks offer many advantages:
• Anonymity - during a physical attack, whether we are
talking about theft or an airstrike, it is easy to find out
the identity of the attacker. However, finding the author
of a virus or an operator of a botnet can take a lot of
time.
• Less physical damage - sometimes the attacker’s goal is
to gain profit or just financially damage the victim. For
example, if Israel launched an airstrike on Iran, it would
lead to the death of many innocent civilians.
• Fewer costs - a cyber attack can cost way less than a
physical attack. Again, in the case of Stuxnet, it would
cost Israel more to launch an airstrike than it cost to make
the worm.
• Better scalability: viruses and worms can spread through
tens of thousands of computers in a short period. For
example, computers all around the world were infected
with the WannaCry ransomware, originating from North
Korea.

Student2:
Cyber attack is a broad term that covers many types of attacks
like Malware attacks, phishing, password attack,
Ransomware, DNS hijacking, Dos and DDoS attacks, and
many more. Each attack aims to fulfill a specific task; for
example, Dos or DdoS attacks are meant to shut down a
machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended
users. While cybercriminals typically use a malware
attack to extract data they can leverage over victims for
financial gain. Phishing attacks are one of the most
popular types of attacks where an attacker mimics to be a
trusted person and sends fake emails that look typical to an
original email. These emails usually have a link to redirect
the victim to a fake website and enter their log-in credentials,
which get stolen by the attacker. Another attack is called a
Man-in-the-middle attack, also known as an eavesdropping
attack, where an attacker intercepts a connection between two
parties and can view the data sent between them that could be
personal such as bank details or log-in credentials. Likewise,
every attack is designed with a different purpose.
Cyber attacks are not only restricted to software-related
attacks or data theft. There are many types of cyber-physical
attacks, such as Data Injection attacks, where a harmful code
is injected into industrial control systems that cause the
system to operate in a strange way that might result in
physical damage, like the Stuxnet attack in 2010. If a
physical attack is intended for monetary purposes, alternative
cyber approaches reduce the risk of exposure to the public as
much as physical theft. Moreover, victims of cyber attacks
are much larger than a typical physical attack, making it more
profitable to criminals. Furthermore, attackers can use
numerous tools to mask themselves on the internet, making
them harder to be identified. In addition, cyber-attacks are
also used by nations in cyber war to obtain confidential
information or attack organizations such as national nuclear
power plants. Another advantage of cyber attacks over
physical attacks is that attacks can target victims overseas,
which makes it more convenient for criminals.

With the rise of the IoT and crypto industries, the
development of AI and machine learning, and frankly, the
inescapable digitalization of every aspect of our lives, the digital
world finds itself in a rather troubling situation. There are
various cyber threats that pose threat to computer systems
nowadays and it does not seem that their number is going to
diminish. Cyber worms, botnets, rootkits and backdoors,
different types of ransomwares, DDoS attacks, spam, and
phishing (especially email phishing), trojans, backdoors, etc. –
all the after-mentioned vulnerabilities pose a tremendous threat
to computer systems. In our readings, we have extensively
covered some infamous examples of such vulnerabilities: the
Stuxnet cyber worm which was used to attack Nantanz nuclear
facility in Iran, the Mirai botnet, which was utilized to
primarily attack IoT devices in targeted regions worldwide,
WannaCry and Petya ransomware (that used EternalBlue and
DoublePulsar exploits) and infected hundreds of thousands of
systems, and many others.
Cybercriminals may utilize various means to attain their
goals, the list of which is quite extensive. There can be numerous
motivations behind cyber threats as they may be performed by
various parties/individuals, such as governments, terrorists,
hacktivists, etc. All of them have their proper objectives, the
majority of which can belong to some of the common groups:
curiosity (most applicable to individual script kiddies),
vandalism, hacktivism, industrial espionage, extortion or fraud,
and information warfare.
Cyber-attacks are intended for those who prefer to act sleek
and stealthy, and thus entities/individuals/governments
oftentimes utilize those instead of straight-on physical attacks to
act more discretely. The motivation to conduct an attack
anonymously is also another factor to bear in mind. In the case
of governments this enables them to perform the attack without
bearing consequences (if its origin remains undetected) or it can
enable them to avoid additional challenges related to
international law. In the case of Stuxnet for instance, where there
was presumably an immediate need for an intervention in Iran's
growing nuclear program, the US and Israel both knew that
military action would destabilize the region and incur
consequences and retaliation from Iran and thus chose to employ
digital means instead.
However, some parties, terrorist groups, for instance, may
employ classical methods of combat. Blowing something off or
any other physical attacks do not require sophistication and
computer skills in most cases. Furthermore, if the primary goal
is to gain attention with an act of some sort, terrorist groups may
still prefer to perform a physical attack simply because it is more
demonstrative. A bombing or a terror attack would certainly
attract much higher attention from both media and the general
public than an infiltration into a network of critical
infrastructure. Although, one may argue that if significant
damage is caused, resulting in say a flood due to a malfunction
in a dam’s control system or any other sort of disaster, this would
certainly attract as much attention as in the latter case.
Infrastructure that can be targeted includes electrical systems
and blackouts; telecommunications services and internet/voice
communication, etc. However, as the readings that we covered
suggest, there has not yet been such a case, as in the majority of
cases, an attacker cannot perform an attack of such complexity.
The complexity of cyberattacks coupled with the low chance of
a successful attack demotivates the terrorists. However, if an
attack on critical infrastructure is successful it might as well
attract as much attention as physical attacks.
Scalability is another parameter that plays a vital role in any
cyber-attack. To scale up a physical attack, would require
bringing additional troops, and military equipment, which can
be extremely troublesome in logistical terms, especially during
a battle. Whereas in the case of cyber-attacks, one might argue
that scalability is relatively simpler, as it implies the deployment
of more computing resources, which can be done quicker than
say shipment of additional equipment to the battlefield. This,
however, does not imply it is easy in all terms.

GPT 1:
There are many different types of cyber threats that organizations and individuals may face. Some common types include:
	•	Malware: software designed to harm or exploit a computer system, such as viruses, trojans, and ransomware.
	•	Phishing: social engineering tactics used to trick people into giving away sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information.
	•	Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks: an attempt to make a website or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.
	•	Advanced persistent threats (APTs): a prolonged and targeted cyber attack in which an attacker establishes an unlawful, long-term presence on a network in order to steal sensitive data.
Motivations behind cyber attacks can vary, but often include financial gain, espionage, or political motivations. For example, a cyber criminal may use malware to steal credit card information for financial gain, while a nation-state actor may use APT tactics for espionage. Additionally, physical attacks can be risky and difficult to execute, whereas cyber attacks can be launched from anywhere in the world, making it a popular choice for individuals or groups looking to cause disruption or steal sensitive information.

GPT 2:
The cyber-threat landscape is constantly evolving and can be broken down into several different categories. One of the most common types of cyber-threats is malware, which is software designed to harm or exploit a computer or network. This can include viruses, worms, and trojans, which can infect and spread through a system, causing damage or stealing sensitive information. Another common type of cyber-threat is phishing, which is a tactic used to trick individuals into providing personal information or login credentials.
Another category of cyber-threats includes ransomware, which is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom payment to restore access. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are another type of cyber-threat, which are typically used by state-sponsored actors or criminal groups to gain long-term access to a target's network and steal sensitive information.
The motivation behind using cyber-attacks instead of physical attacks can vary depending on the attacker's goals. Some attackers may be motivated by financial gain, such as stealing sensitive information that can be sold on the black market or extorting a ransom payment. Others may be motivated by political or ideological goals, such as attempting to disrupt critical infrastructure or steal sensitive government or military information. Cyber-attacks can also be used to disrupt business operations or damage a company's reputation. Additionally, cyber-attacks can be launched from anywhere in the world, making them a low-risk, high-reward option for attackers.


GPT 3:
The cyber-threat landscape is constantly evolving, but some common types of threats include malware, phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Malware refers to malicious software that can infect a computer or device and allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or disrupt operations. Phishing refers to attempts to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, through fraudulent email or website. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a website or network with traffic to disrupt service.
The motivation behind using cyber-attacks instead of physical attacks is often the ability to carry out an attack remotely and with a lower risk of being caught. Cyber-attacks can also be more cost-effective and have a greater potential impact than physical attacks. Additionally, many organizations and individuals have valuable information stored electronically, making it a more attractive target for cybercriminals. Additionally, it is also a way for hackers to disrupt services of a company or government without having a physical presence in the location.

Question 6: Please choose one contemporary cyber-threat and describe, in a few paragraphs, the following: The motivation behind using this cyber-threat, the delivery method, how the cyber-threat works, results of the cyber-threat, discuss historical data describing the number of infected devices (victims) over time (annually), also describing what sources did you use to find the information, whether there has there been an increase or decrease, and why. For the previous chosen threat, discuss historical data quantifying the cost of the cyber-threat over time (annually) – if no data is available show how you estimate the cost. Is the cost increasing or decreasing? Why? What are the deployed solutions against the cyber-threat? Give 2 examples of the cyber-threat.

Student1:
Encrypting ransomware attacks are some of the most
widespread cyber attacks.
There are many ways of delivering ransomware to the
victims’ computers. Most of the delivery methods described in
the first section can be used: worms can be used for installing
ransomware; semantic attacks can be used for tricking the
victim into downloading the ransomware by themselves; the
program can also be delivered physically, with a USB drive,
for example.
After installation, the ransomware program encrypts certain
types of files. The files essential for the computer’s operation
are avoided. Some of the most frequently encrypted files
include PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and TXT files. Mostly, these
files have huge importance for the victims, and the only way
for them to get the files back is to pay the ransom. Because the
files are encrypted and the attacker is the only one who knows
the key, there is no other way around it. Bitcoin is mostly used
as a payment method for ransom because of its anonymity. To
further protect their anonymity, the attackers mostly use many
bitcoin addresses.
Ransomware attacks can have different outcomes:
• The victim decides to give up the data and doesn’t pay
the ransom.
• The victim pays the ransom. In this case, the users can
recover their data but not fully.
• If the victim is a company and doesn’t pay the ransom,
the attackers may release its data to the public.
Ransomware attacks can have a huge impact on companies.
The ransom they have to pay to recover their data can range
from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Other
than that, because of the lost data, their operations are delayed
which also can cost them money.
Using ransomware is quite attractive to cyber criminals
because of several reasons:
• Easily spread just like most other malware - there are
many ways of delivering ransomware.
• Can be automated - after infection, the attackers don’t
have to do much.
• Preservation of anonymity - technologies such as Bitcoin
allow attackers to receive money without being discov-
ered.
• High monetary gain - companies are willing to pay huge
sums of money to get their data back

Using data provided by SonicWall Capture Labs in
the ”2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report”, we see
a massive surge in 2021. One of the explanations
for this is the fact that as many organizations switched to re-
mote work because of the pandemic, their security decreased.
However, ransomware attacks have decreased in 2022. One
of the reasons for this is the massive fall in the prices of
cryptocurrencies. Another explanation offered by the report connects
this fact to the war in Ukraine. One of the
major sources of ransomware attacks is Russia. Because of
this, as Russia started the war, it shifted its whole focus to
Ukraine, which resulted in fewer attacks. Also, because of
the sanctions by many countries, Russian cybercriminals faced
difficulty gathering means for the attacks.
The decrease in the number of ransomware attacks doesn’t
mean that it will be going away. Ransomware attacks are a
great way for cybercriminals to get monetary gain, and the
attacks will probably increase once more as the war ends
and/or cryptocurrencies become more stable.

Average cost of remediation from
ransomware attacks data is gathered from the surveys
conducted by Sophos in the years 2019-2022. One strange
thing here is that the average cost of remediation decreases
from 2020 to 2021. However, this doesn’t mean that the total
costs decrease. Because the number of attacks in 2021 was
much more than in 2020, the total cost will be more in 2021.
However, the reason for the decrease in the average cost of
remediation, is that the companies have
learned more about recovering from data losses. Still, we can
see that the financial losses are tremendous.
From the victim’s side, nothing can be done to counter the
ransomware if it already has encrypted the files. Because of
this, countermeasures against ransomware have to be taken
before it is installed. The main way to do this is to make sure
that the ransomware cannot be delivered to the computer. To
protect against the use of exploits by the attacker, the operating
system and all third-party software have to be frequently
updated. To protect against semantic attacks, the users have
to be educated. Also, malware detection software can be used
for detecting ransomware. However, this also has to be chosen
carefully, as many anti-virus applications can be malicious
themselves. For ransomware specifically, another solution is to
back up all the important data so that it can be easily restored
if it is lost.
One of the most known ransomware is the WannaCry worm.
It targeted Windows machines and used the EternalBlue ex-
ploit for propagation. Although Windows had released patches
for that vulnerability, WannaCry was still able to spread
because many people didn’t update their operating systems.
WannaCry started attacks in May 2017 and accepted pay-
ments in Bitcoin. The author of the ransomware is considered
to be the North Korean government.
Another interesting case is the TeslaCrypt ransomware. Its
attacks started in 2015 and were originally targeting gamers
(”saved games, user profiles, replays of some popular games
like League of Legends, Call of Duty or Minecraft”).
However, TeslaCrypt later got developed into full-fledged
ransomware that encrypted other types of files as well. The
ransom message was displayed on the desktop, and the victims
were given a chance to decrypt one file to trust that their
files would be returned if they paid the ransom. In
2016, however, the developers released the master key, making
TeslaCrypt ineffective.

Student2:
A. Motivation behind DDOS Attacks
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are used by
attackers for many reasons like:

Financial gain or economic benefit: Hackers use
DDoS attacks as financial weapons, demanding
Bitcoin through email to stop the attack.

Revenge: DDoS attacks on organizations or
individuals where the dissatisfied individual or
organization behind the attack usually intends to
inflict harm in retaliation for a perceived violation.


Ideological belief: hacktivist groups like anonymous
attack political targets for ideological reasons, such
as opposition to a nation-state or government
policies, or they do not accept their ethics or do not
perceive their actions as ethical.

B. Delievery mothod / How DDOS attacks work
DDoS attacks occur in three stages:

In the first phase, Hackers get access to network-
connected computers. Hackers scan the internet for
computers or Internet of Things devices that can be
compromised using an automated process.

The second phase starts when sufficient numbers of
computers are compromised, and these machines are
called Botnets. Instructions are then sent to these
botnets to launch an attack on a specific network or
organization.

Finally, Hackers direct the army of botnets to attack
a virtual machine that causes the machine to slow
down or may even crash the server. As these attacks
are distributed from many locations, the victim’s
system cannot identify where the attack is initiated
and cannot block the incoming traffic. Moreover, IP
addresses of compromised devices sending requests
to the server can be spoofed, which prevents the
victim from filtering malicious traffic to find the
attack source.

DDoS attacks in general are classified into 3 main categories:
volumetric attack, protocol attack, and resource layer attack.

Volumetric attacks are the most common form of
DDoS attacks where the network layer is
overwhelmed with service requests that may appear
legitimate. DNS amplification is an example of a
volumetric attack where the attacker exploits
vulnerabilities in Domain naming system servers to
amplify small requests to much larger payloads,
which brings down the victim’s servers.

By exploiting vulnerabilities in the layer three and
layer four protocol stack, a protocol attack causes a
service disruption. SYN flood is a good example
where an attacker initiates many connections to the
server without finalizing them, and the server has to
spend much of its resources waiting for unfinalized
open connections to be finalized which causes the
server to be unresponsive to legitimate attacks

A resource layer attack interrupts data transmission
between hosts by targeting web application packets.
Examples of such attacks include SQL injection and
layer seven attacks.

C. Impact of the DDoS on victims
In a DDoS attack, many requests are sent to a server
overwhelmingly, forcing that site or resource to go offline
or reject legitimate requests. Attacks usually target
businesses, and in the event of a successful attack,
businesses are affected in many ways, including making
network resources inaccessible to employees of the
organization, which leads to downtime that prevents
customers from receiving required assistance as they are
unable to reach specialized professionals. Moreover, if a
web server hosts an e-commerce site, no customer would
be able to make purchases, costing the business valuable
clients and significantly impacting the business’s
reputation. A study by Kaspersky Lab showed that one in
five attacks could last for days or weeks. This shows how
big a threat DDoS attacks can be to businesses, as they
can lose up to $20,000 per hour.

D. DDoS attacks over time
According to Cisco in a white paper released as part of the
company’s more extensive report, “Visual Networking Index
Complete Forecast Update, 2015-2020.” The frequency
of DDoS attacks has increased over 2.5 times in the last 3
years (2017 – 2020) where the average size of each attack is
at a constant increase and approaching 1 Gbps; however, this
is outdated as recent research shows that the average attack
in the 3rd quarter of 2021 used 4.31Gbps of data which is
enough to bring down most small to medium-sized websites.
However, this number is much lower than the Q1 2021 metric
of 9.15 Gbps. However, nothing compared to the most
prominent attack launched by the Mirai botnet variant that
peaked at 2.5 Tbps (terabytes per second) according to
Cloudflare, which described it as the most significant attack
in terms of bitrate.
DDoS attacks have been increasing exponentially over the
past few years, and especially during the pandemic that
everyone online in Q2 2022, a significant and long-lasting
spike was witnessed in the number of attacks. Since we are
still using the internet at the same capacity, the net number of
attacks is expected to keep increasing.

Cisco predicts that in 2023 the number the total number
of DDoS attacks will cross 15 million. DDoS attacks are
not just increasing alone, malicious actors are creating an
even bigger army of botnets, increasing the scale of DDoS
attacks. Attacks of 1 Gbps can knock down an
organization’s servers, but now attacks can reach up to
1Tbps generated by millions of infected devices.
As attacks are generated more often with a massive
increase in size, Business losses are increasing
exponentially. Furthermore, since IT services downtime
costs organizations between $300,000 to over $1,000,000
per hour, you can see the impact caused by an attack even
for a short period. Since there are ineffective solutions to
eliminate DDoS attacks, we do not expect to see a decline
in the number of attacks soon.

E. How to prevent a DDoS attack:
One of the most effective ways to reduce the chances of
getting attacked is by creating a Denial of Service
Response Plan. This would take some time to plan as it
depends on the complexity of the organizational
infrastructure. Another method is by using firewalls;
however, as some attacks target firewalls, it is suggested
to put data centers on multiple networks that are not in the
same geographical region and install servers in different
data centers and ensure there is no place where traffic
bottlenecks in the network. DDoS attacks are not new to
the cyber world, and many widespread DDoS attacks are
similar. Using anti-DDoS software or hardware would
help prevent these common types of attacks increasing the
network’s security. Another way is by knowing your
network’s traffic. For example, if an organization
provides services only for a particular region or country,
significant traffic is not expected from other countries.
Hence if an attack is made from a different country, it
would be easily identified and blocked immediately
instead of overwhelming the server and rejecting
legitimate requests .

F. Example of DDoS attacks
The Mirai Botnet: Mirai malware first scanned IP
addresses of devices connected to the internet and
identified IoT devices that run a version of Linux called
ARC. The malware exploits its security vulnerabilities to
gain network access using default passwords. If the
owner/user has not changed the default password, this
intelligent device is added to the list of botnets on
standby, waiting for an order to flood a target with
requests. Over 600,000 devices were infected with Mirai,
which was used to attack the DNS provider and registrar
DYN on October 2016.

The GitHub attack in 2018: This attack is particularly
effective as it uses an amplification factor where the ratio of
the attacker request size to the amount of traffic generated is
up to 51,200 times! Even though GitHub is prepared for
DDoS attacks, its defences were overwhelmed by the
enormous amount of traffic caused by the amplification .
GitHub explained in the company’s incident report: “Over the
past year, we have deployed additional transit to our facilities.
We have more than doubled our transit capacity during that
time, which has allowed us to withstand certain volumetric
attacks without impact to users … Even still, attacks like this
sometimes require the help of partners with larger transit
networks to provide blocking and filtering”.

Student3:
DDOS BOTNETS
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the
most common types of cyber-attacks. The first quarter of 2022
broke all records in terms of DDoS attacks (hitting more than
90,000 attacks, for reference, only 20,000 attacks were
conducted during the same quarter the year prior), and they
accounted for approximately 59% of all the attacks in 2022
according to the Application Protection Report by F5 Labs.
In addition, the strength and size of attacks are steadily
increasing according to the same report. DDoS attacks
undoubtedly present a serious concern to overall web security.
Having those reasons in mind, DDoS attacks were chosen as the
subject of our further discussion.

A botnet is essentially a group of computers infected with
malware that performs commands given by an attacker.
Attackers that employ a such type of cyber threat can have a
specific target in mind, in which case they would direct all the
power towards an individual target, or, as in the case of one of
the biggest DDoS attacks ever recorded - Mirai, the attack can
be dispersed, tackling thousands of devices. Employing such a
“shotgun” sort of approach, it managed to infect more than
600,000 devices, the majority of which were IoT devices, setting
a record at the time. The major goals of the attackers utilizing
botnets include stealing data, sending spam, or undermining
their competitors, etc. Another prominent DDoS attack was
performed in Q1 of 2020 on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
servers. Amazon claimed about the attack in its AWS Shield
Threat Landscape report. A month before that, another
attack of 1.3 Tbps hit Github. Judging from the frequency
of DDoS attacks, we can certainly say that they represent a major
threat in cyberspace nowadays.

DDoS botnet attacks are essentially performed using a
network of bots i.e. computers, servers, IoT devices, and any
other devices that are infected with malicious software (exploit)
and are remotely controlled by an attacker. To accumulate
the network of bots, firstly, one must spread the exploit to
devices. Delivery of the exploit can happen physically (by
injecting an infected USB drive and connecting the destination
system manually by a cable) as well as remotely. The protocols
used by DDoS exploits include FTP, POP3, TCP&UDP.
Botnet sends an enormous flow of traffic to a specific
destination (a server) using all of the accumulated computing
power, creating congestion for the traffic from ordinary web
users trying to access the site. The strength of a DDoS
attack is measured in Tbps (Terabytes per second), i.e., in terms
of the amount of data it transmits to the server in a unit of time.
In the Layer7 type of attack, the strength of a DDoS attack
depends on the size of the pool of IP addresses and on the power
of the servers/devices the attack is being conducted from. In the
Layer4 type of attack, the power can be adjusted when it is
initiated. There is a certain threshold of traffic that can be
sustained by a server and thus, a DDoS attack exceeds that limit
and disrupts the network. An end user trying to access a website
that is under a DDoS attack will experience either a slower
response time for the website in question or its complete outage.
After extensive penetration, the target system would stop
responding and invoke the denial-of-service to the incoming
traffic, and the server will halt.

DDoS attacks incur enormous financial losses for business
owners whose websites are attacked, as they lose revenue while
their websites are down. The competitors of the businesses in
question can benefit from such a disruption in the short run as
the customers who were willing to purchase products or services
from the business entity will now turn to other firms to find
suitable substitutes. Many firms in fact oftentimes utilize
services provided by DDoS hackers.

Businesses may also incur losses in reputation due to the
DDoS attack which in turn might affect them in the long run.
DDoS attacks might undermine the national security of targeted
countries if the attack is performed on a government’s websites
or communication means. This was also briefly mentioned in
one of our readings (DDoS attacks on Estonia and Georgia).
The statistics regarding the DDoS attacks over the time
period from Q4 2020 until Q2 2022 are presented in Figure 1
(Such a time period was chosen due to insufficient data provided
in the reports for the earlier years). The data was taken from
Kaspersky’s Securelist which was compiled using Kaspersky’s
proprietary DDoS Intelligence system. While we can clearly see
the upwardly increasing trend in DDoS detections (up until Q1
2022), we have to bear in mind that the following graph was
solely based on the data from the after-mentioned source, and it
does not represent the entire picture of DDoS detections
worldwide, even though Kaspersky is a reliable source in the
cyber security world. The reports used even mention that DDoS
Intelligence statistics only consider the botnets detected by
Kaspersky and do not include all the DDoS attacks that took
place within a given time period.

As seen from the Kaspersky DDoS Intelligence system,
there has been an upward trend in
DDoS attacks up until Q1 of 2022 when it peaks. There were
about 14% fewer detections observed in Q2 2022 than in the
previous quarter, however, as the report presented by Kaspersky
suggests, the overall situation might actually have worsened as
the quality of the attacks performed is getting increasingly
complex in comparison with previous years. Furthermore, the
report mentions that botnet activity grew and links the increase
in DDoS activity with the decline in the crypto industry as this
commonly boosted DDoS attacks in previous years.

Other data acquired from Cisco Annual Internet Report suggest
the trend presented in DDoS attacks over the period of 2018-2023.
In general, DDoS attacks are still
on the rise, and it seems that they will continue to do so.
In terms of solutions that one might utilize in order to prevent
or ward off an incoming DDoS attack, there are so-called DIY
measures such as manually blacklisting specific IPs, but those
are not that effective and oftentimes are utilized measures after
an attack had been conducted. More advanced approaches can
include utilizing specialized hardware that can filter traffic, this
however incurs huge costs for the host and sometimes is not
available to certain hosts. Another option is using cloud-
based/ISP-provided solutions, which are more beneficial than
the latter, as they facilitate scalability, which is usually a major
issue in the case of hardware solutions. In addition, they are
relatively cheaper in comparison to hardware solutions.

If we were to think about the cost of DDoS attacks, it would
be logical to assume that the average cost of an attack should
increase as its complexity and the level of sophistication
required to bypass the security of a given system. But the price,
however, has dropped significantly over recent years due to a
huge supply of DDoS attackers offering their services to firms
and individuals. Unfortunately, we were not able to find factual
information about the prices of DDoS attacks over the years.

GPT 1:
The contemporary cyber-threat I have chosen is Ransomware.
The motivation behind using Ransomware is to extort money from victims by encrypting their data and demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key. The delivery method is typically through phishing emails or malicious software downloads.
Once the ransomware is downloaded, it encrypts the victim's files and demands payment in the form of cryptocurrency in exchange for the decryption key. The results of a ransomware attack can range from minimal to severe, depending on the amount of data encrypted and the importance of the data to the victim. In some cases, victims may choose to pay the ransom to regain access to their data, while in others, they may choose to restore their data from backups or use decryption tools.
According to data from the Cyber Threat Alliance, the number of ransomware attacks has been steadily increasing over the past several years, with a significant spike in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, there were approximately 4,000 reported ransomware attacks per day, and in 2017, that number had risen to 6,000 per day. The sources used for this information include the Cyber Threat Alliance, the FBI, and cybersecurity companies such as Symantec and McAfee.
The cost of ransomware attacks has also been increasing over time. According to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, the cost of ransomware attacks is expected to reach $11.5 billion in 2019. This is an increase from the estimated cost of $325 million in 2015. The cost increase can be attributed to the rising number of attacks and the increasing sophistication of the ransomware being used.
Solutions against ransomware include implementing robust backups, educating employees on identifying and avoiding phishing emails, and implementing endpoint protection software. Two examples of ransomware are WannaCry and Petya. WannaCry was responsible for a global ransomware attack in May 2017, affecting more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries. Petya was a ransomware attack that affected several high-profile companies in June 2017, including Ukraine's international airport and metro system, as well as Danish shipping giant Maersk.
GPT 2:
The contemporary cyber-threat chosen is Ransomware.
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment, usually in the form of cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key. The motivation behind using ransomware is financial gain for the attackers.
The delivery method for ransomware can vary, but common methods include phishing emails, exploit kits, and drive-by downloads.
Once the ransomware has been delivered and executed, it will encrypt the victim's files and display a ransom note, usually with instructions on how to pay the ransom. The victim is then given a deadline to pay the ransom before the decryption key is deleted, making the files permanently inaccessible.
According to data from the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, there were 4,086 reported ransomware attacks in 2019, causing a total loss of $11.5 million. This represents a significant increase from 2018, when there were 2,573 reported attacks resulting in a loss of $3.6 million.
In terms of cost, it can be difficult to estimate the exact cost of ransomware attacks as not all victims report the attacks or disclose the amount paid in ransom. However, according to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, the cost of ransomware is expected to exceed $11.5 billion annually by 2021.
To combat ransomware, solutions such as backup and disaster recovery, endpoint protection, and employee education and training can be deployed. Two examples of ransomware are WannaCry and Petya. WannaCry was a global ransomware attack that affected over 200,000 victims in 150 countries in May 2017. Petya is a ransomware attack that encrypts the master boot record of the victim's computer, rendering it inoperable.

GPT 3:
One contemporary cyber-threat that has been prevalent in recent years is Ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.
The motivation behind using Ransomware is to make money. Attackers often target businesses and organizations as they are more likely to pay the ransom to regain access to their important data. The delivery method for Ransomware can vary, but it is often delivered through phishing emails or through vulnerabilities in software.
Once the Ransomware is on a device, it encrypts the victim's files and displays a message demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key. The results of a Ransomware attack can be devastating for a business or organization as they may lose access to important data and may have to pay the ransom to regain access.
According to data from the Cyber Threat Alliance, there has been a steady increase in the number of Ransomware attacks over the past few years. In 2016, there were around 4,000 Ransomware attacks per quarter, which increased to around 6,000 attacks per quarter in 2017. This data was sourced from the Cyber Threat Alliance's Ransomware Intelligence Report.
The cost of Ransomware attacks can vary depending on the size of the organization and the amount of data that has been encrypted. According to a report from Cybersecurity Ventures, the cost of Ransomware attacks is projected to reach $11.5 billion by 2019. This cost includes the ransom payments, as well as the cost of recovering from the attack.
Solutions against Ransomware include implementing regular backups, keeping software up to date, and educating employees about the dangers of phishing emails. Two examples of Ransomware include WannaCry and Petya. WannaCry was a global Ransomware attack that affected over 200,000 devices in 150 countries in 2017. Petya was another Ransomware attack that affected businesses and organizations worldwide in 2017.

Question 7: This is a hypothetical discussion about the future of the cyber-threat landscape. Please answer, in a few paragraphs, whether cyber-attacks are more or less dangerous than physical attacks and how? Use empirical data to support your answer. Do you think that the solutions available are effective in protecting the cyber-world from these attacks? Describe a scenario showing how these cyber-threats can be used in cyber warfare? Guesstimate, using data available, the timeframe a cyberwar is likely to happen within?

Student1:
Comparing physical and cyber-attacks in terms of how dan-
gerous they are is quite tricky, as the word ”dangerous” in this
context is vague. It is easy to estimate the immediate damage
of physical attacks, but cyber attacks are different - their
consequences may last for a long time and have an indirect
effect on many circumstances. During the Second World War,
the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nuked, causing
roughly 110,000 immediate deaths and many more afterward.
Of course, there has been no precedent of a cyber attack
causing so much death and destruction. In the same war, Alan
Turing was able to crack the Germans’ encryption system. This
played a role in the US’s victory in WW2 because it gave the
US many advantages when it entered the war. However, it’s
not possible to quantify how much damage this knowledge
caused to Germans. Today, if other countries tried to attack
USA’s critical infrastructures, they would most likely not be
able to cause much damage (compared to mass destruction
weapons). Still, although there’s no precedent of a cyber
attack causing mass destruction, we cannot say that such a
thing is impossible. Literature highlights that countries
are planting cyber weapons in their enemies’ territories so that
they can activate them in case of conflict. Because of this,
destructive cyber weapons might exist that we do not know
of yet. For example, Stuxnet was able to negatively affect the
production of nuclear energy in Iran, but there might be a
possibility of a similar worm being able to cause an incident
like Chornobyl.
However, if we compare physical and cyber attacks outside
physical warfare, we can say that cyber attacks are more
dangerous. Cyber attacks can be used politically, for example,
launching a DDoS attack and shutting down websites that
promote different political opinions. As we saw in the previous
section, a cyber attack may cost a company millions of dollars
of damage. With devices/computers/networks, we cannot say
that 100% security has been achieved. There always will be
ways for attackers to find vulnerabilities.
The main solutions against spreading malware include user
education and regularly updating software. However, there
will probably always be vulnerabilities in software - zero-day
exploits - that we can do nothing about until it gets fixed. Also,
there will always be lazy people that do not make enough effort
for security.
As we discussed, physical and cyber-attacks have advan-
tages and disadvantages against each other in different aspects.
Because of this, during actual warfare, a combination of both
is used. For example, when Russia invaded Georgia in 2008,
it also launched DDoS attacks on the Georgian government’s
websites and independent media to make it harder for the
government to communicate with the people. Estonia’s
national networks were similarly attacked by Russia in 2007.
Cyber attacks can also be used for gathering valuable
information about enemies during warfare. Alan Turing’s
cracking of the German cipher can be considered one such
case.
Thus, we can see that the most dangerous attack is the one
that combines a physical and a cyber one.

Student2:
A. Are cyber-attacks more or less dangerous than
physical attacks and how?
Cyber threats are much more dangerous than ever, and
attacks can now cause electrical blackouts, military
equipment failure, or even breaches of national secrets.
Cyber-attacks, with their frequency today, create a
huge concern; cybercrime rates are off the charts and
increasing exponentially. According to the FBI’s annual
look at phishing, scam, and personal data breach, US
victims lost more than $6.9 Billion to internet-Enabled
Crimes only in 2021. Stealing confidential data could
result in serious harm to individuals and nations as a
whole. Common data breaches can steal sensitive data like
medical records—bank account credentials, passwords,
addresses, or emails that put victims at risk of identity
theft. According to FTC (Federal Trade Commission), the
number of consumer identity theft complaints in the US
increased to just over 1.43 million in 2021 compared to
1.39 million complaints in 2020 with credit card fraud is
the second most common form of identity theft with
390,000 complains after Government documents or
benefits fraud with around 400,000 complains.
Cyber-attacks also cause property damage. For example,
in 2008, a massive oil pipeline explosion in Refahiye,
Turkey, is believed to be caused by a cyber-attack.
Another similar case occurred in 2021 when the US
Colonial Pipeline experienced a ransomware attack that
caused it to shut down for several days, causing many
petrol stations and commercial airlines to experience fuel
shortages.
In 2010 Iran witnessed a one-of-a-kind worm called the
Stuxnet. This worm had four zero-day vulnerabilities
configured to attack a specific Siemens device,
specifically the Siemens S7 programmable logic
controller. This device was used in the Iranian nuclear
plant and caused the devices to malfunction and work
abnormally, which severely crippled Iran’s nuclear
program. To date, no one is sure which country created this
worm, which shows the anonymity of cyber attacks. These
are just a couple of the attacks that show the power of
cyber weapons.
B. Are solutions available effective in protecting the
cyber-world from these attacks?
Cyber security is critical today and plays a major role in
keeping countries safe. However, no matter how high the
level of security is, there will always be vulnerabilities that
have not been exploited yet. There are many tools created
to protect users against various “Known” types of worms.
However, it is impossible to achieve 100% security as new
vulnerabilities
are
discovered
daily,
inspiring
cybercriminals to develop malware that exploits these
vulnerabilities. On the other hand, firewalls and other
discussed tools can be used to reduce the impact of an
attack. Moreover, small businesses can depend on other
specialist organizations like GitHub to defend their
systems against attacks.
C. How cyber-threats can be used in cyber warfare
Many cyber weapons could be used to attack nations, and
if effectively combined, they might have an effect more
remarkable than a nuclear weapon. There are seven types
of cyber warfare attacks: Espionage, Sabotage, DoS attack,
Electrical power grid attack, Propaganda attack, Economic
disruption, and surprise attacks. Espionage refers to
tracking countries to obtain their secrets. This can involve
spear phishing attacks to compromise the target’s system
before extracting the information.
Countries can combine attacks for a more significant
effect; for example, a country can use espionage to obtain
information about the transportation control system and
via insider attack, they can cause accidents between trains
or disable train signals causing pedestrians to falsely think
that it is safe to pass the train trail. Countries can also
launch attacks on nuclear facilities of other countries that
may be life threatening.

Student3:
Whilst considering which type of attacks cause more
damage, physical or cyber, I believe that the main factor of
consideration should be the ease of access. While it might be
troublesome for an attacker to surpass certain security measures,
however, if he/she does not need to be physically at the site of
the attack to conduct it, and the access can be gained remotely,
then this presents a huge advantage for him/her. Of course, this
is not applicable to all the attacks, since some of them would
require some physical steps as in the case of Stuxnet where there
was a need to overcome the “air gap” between the nuclear
facility and the rest of the world, but if there a possibility to
conduct an attack fully remotely, then the attacker has a relative
advantage as there is no distance between him and his target.
There have been numerous instances of relatively
destructive cyber-attacks in the past: Stuxnet, which attacked the
Iranian Natanz Nuclear Facility, Wiper malware that was used
to erase hard drives of Iranian Oil Companies, Shamoon virus
that was used to tackle Saudi Aramco and Qatar’s RasGas oil
companies, etc. Those attacks were orchestrated with direct
objectives to either destroy or damage specific data or objects
and the level of sophistication and damages produced by such
attacks are only going to increase in future. It would have been
significantly harder to tackle all those targets by solely physical
means since scalability would be an issue in some of the
mentioned attacks. For instance, it would have been close to
impossible to physically breach the security in all 30,000 Saudi
Aramco gas stations and erase and overwrite the hard drives in
each and every one of them, and the same applies to Wiper too.
We do think that the existing solutions are doing a great job
of protecting the systems in the current context, given the
existing threats. However, as the share of the IoT industry in our
world increases and its integration into our daily lives (smart
fridges, kettles, climate control systems, HVAC, heating and
water systems) so does the probability of greater and more
severe breaches in security to occur, which can potentially bring
devastating consequences. For instance, if somebody gains
access to the heating system of a house, he/she might potentially
set it on fire if the wrong settings are applied. To combat this,
manufacturers would need to employ even better security
practices, and enhance testing and research, and development in
the after-mentioned areas.


GPT 1:
It is difficult to compare the danger of cyber-attacks versus physical attacks as they both have unique risks and impacts. However, it is clear that cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and dangerous. According to data from the Cyber Threat Alliance, the number of cyber-attacks has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with a significant increase in the number of ransomware attacks. In addition, the cost of cyber-attacks is also on the rise, with a projected cost of $11.5 billion by 2019, according to a report from Cybersecurity Ventures.
The solutions available for protecting the cyber-world from these attacks are effective to some extent, but they are not foolproof. Regular backups, keeping software up to date, and educating employees about the dangers of phishing emails are some examples of solutions that can help protect against cyber-attacks. However, attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass these solutions, making it difficult to fully protect against cyber-attacks.
In terms of cyber warfare, a scenario could involve a nation-state launching a cyber-attack on another nation's critical infrastructure, such as power plants or transportation systems. This could cause widespread disruption and potentially even loss of life. Additionally, it could also be used to steal sensitive information, disrupt communication systems and damage national security.
The timeframe for a cyberwar is difficult to predict as it depends on many factors such as the development of new technologies and the political tensions between nations. However, as the number of cyber-attacks is increasing, it is likely that a cyberwar will happen within the next decade. It is important for governments and organizations to be prepared and take proactive measures to prevent and mitigate the effects of cyberwarfare.


GPT 2:
It is difficult to compare the danger of cyber-attacks to physical attacks as they both have unique risks and consequences. However, it can be argued that cyber-attacks have the potential to be more dangerous than physical attacks as they can cause widespread disruption and damage to critical infrastructure and systems.
According to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the global cost of cybercrime is estimated to be around $600 billion annually. This includes costs such as lost productivity, intellectual property theft, and damage to reputation. Additionally, the number of cyber-attacks has been increasing over the years. A report by Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that there will be a cyber-attack every 11 seconds by 2021.
In contrast, physical attacks are generally limited in scope and have a more direct impact on individuals or specific locations. However, it is important to note that physical attacks can have a significant impact on society as well, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
Currently, solutions available for protecting the cyber-world from cyber-attacks include firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. While these solutions can be effective in protecting against some types of cyber-attacks, they are not foolproof and can be bypassed by skilled attackers. Additionally, as technology continues to advance and new vulnerabilities are discovered, cyber-attacks become more sophisticated and harder to defend against.
In terms of cyber warfare, a scenario could involve a nation-state using cyber-attacks to disrupt the infrastructure of another country. For example, they could target power plants, transportation systems, and communication networks in an attempt to cripple the country's ability to function. Additionally, they could use cyber-attacks to steal sensitive information or disrupt military operations.
It is difficult to estimate a specific timeframe for when a cyberwar may happen, but it is likely that we will see an increase in cyber-attacks used as a tool of warfare in the future. According to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, there have already been instances of cyber-attacks being used in conflicts between nations. As technology continues to advance, the likelihood of a cyberwar happening in the near future increases.


GPT 3:
Whether cyber-attacks are more or less dangerous than physical attacks is a matter of perspective. On one hand, physical attacks can cause immediate harm to individuals, whereas cyber-attacks can have more long-term consequences. For example, a physical attack on a building can cause immediate damage and injury, while a cyber-attack on a company's network can result in the loss of sensitive data and financial loss.
However, cyber-attacks can also have immediate consequences. For example, a cyber-attack on a hospital's network can disrupt the delivery of critical care, potentially causing harm to patients. Additionally, cyber-attacks can have a much wider reach than physical attacks, as they can target victims across the globe.
According to data from the Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime is projected to cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021. This includes the cost of data breaches, cyber espionage, and disruptions to critical infrastructure.
The solutions available for protecting the cyber-world from these attacks are becoming more advanced, but they are not foolproof. For example, firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems can help to prevent cyber-attacks, but they are not 100% effective. Additionally, organizations can implement security protocols such as two-factor authentication and regular security updates, but these measures are not always implemented effectively.
In a cyber warfare scenario, a nation-state could use cyber-attacks to disrupt critical infrastructure, such as power grids, transportation systems, and financial networks. This could cause widespread disruption and potentially lead to physical harm. Additionally, a nation-state could use cyber-attacks to steal sensitive information or disrupt the communication systems of its adversaries.
It is difficult to estimate a specific timeframe for when a cyberwar is likely to happen, but it is clear that the threat of cyber-attacks is increasing. According to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the frequency of cyber incidents involving critical infrastructure has increased from an average of one per month in 2010 to over 200 per month in 2018.
In conclusion, cyber-attacks can be as dangerous or even more dangerous than physical attacks as they can cause immediate harm, financial loss, and long-term consequences. The solutions available to protect the cyber-world are becoming more advanced, but they are not foolproof. Cyberwarfare is a real threat that can cause widespread disruption, steal sensitive information and disrupt communication systems. The frequency of cyber incidents involving critical infrastructure is increasing, and it's hard to estimate a specific timeframe for when a cyberwar is likely to happen.

Set 3:
Question 8: This question discusses performing searches and extracting information from Shodan. Please describe in 7-10 paragraphs, whether Shodan is increasing security or awareness among companies that design and sell IoT devices? How can Shodan be used by attackers? How can Shodan be used by defenders? In 2013, CNN stated that “Shodan: The scariest search engine on the Internet”, Is this true today? Do you agree or disagree, support your answer.

Student1:
Today, there are billions of IoT devices, many of which, be-
cause of limited hardware capabilities, often have bad security.
Securing these devices is very important - the attacks of the
Mirai botnet showed the high magnitude of damage brought
by infected IoT devices.
The case study highlighted Shodan’s capabilities and how
maliciously it can be used for launching attacks related to IoT
devices. Even a security camera installed in a yard can give
adversaries information that they might use for causing much
harm. However, Shodan is also an excellent tool for security
awareness and tracking vulnerabilities. Shodan exposes the
vulnerabilities of anything that it indexes. IoT device man-
ufacturers can use this information to improve the security of
their products, and the knowledge that the vulnerabilities are
publicly available acts as a motivator for them (they have to
fix them as soon as possible before the adversaries discover
them).
Shodan is also widely used for researching the security of
IoT devices. A Google Scholar search reveals that there are
4300 papers that explicitly mention Shodan and security, and
among these, there are 2090 papers (48.6%) that also explicitly
mention IoT or the Internet of Things.
Shodan can be used in many ways by malicious actors.
Many powerful tools (e.g. Metasploit) use Shodan API.
Shodan’s filter system allows users to find desired devices
easily and quickly. For instance, with the ”vuln” filter, it is
possible to search for devices with a certain vulnerability (e.g.
Heartbleed). This can be very useful for an adversary that has
created an exploitative program and is looking for devices for
spreading it. The user-friendliness of Shodan also makes it
possible for script kiddies to easily find publicly accessible
devices (e.g. webcams) and tamper with them.
Many devices on Shodan have the option of installing
updates but are poorly protected. If an adversary gets access to
such a device, he/she can install malware instead of updates.
This malware can be of many types, for example, making the
device a part of a botnet and then using it for DDoS attacks
(This is what happened with the Mirai Botnet).
Devices found on Shodan also include devices (e.g. pro-
grammable logic circuits) that can be parts of critical in-
frastructures. In this case, an adversary tampering with those
devices would bring much harm. For example, as part of the
research, to show the capabilities of Shodan, all of the nuclear
power plants in France were identified.
Shodan also contains information about many web servers
worldwide. A malicious actor could use this information for
orchestrating an appropriate attack, which might lead to data
theft and privacy invasion.
On the other hand, all these capabilities of Shodan can
be used for good as well. White hat hackers can use it to
scan networks, analyze devices and find vulnerabilities. They
can then use the information gathered from Shodan to seal
backdoor access to their devices, maintain secure banners, pro-
tect accidentally exposed databases, or patch vulnerabilities.
With the help of Shodan, all of these can be done before an
adversary discovers those same vulnerabilities. Shodan also
makes it possible to locate malware command and control
servers. In that case, the defenders can even launch an attack
on malicious servers.
Shodan is also widely used by academic researchers for
gathering data and drawing conclusions. As already discussed,
a Google Scholar search of the terms ”Shodan” and ”security”
result in 4300 papers about the topic.
In 2013, CNN stated that “Shodan: The scariest search
engine on the Internet.” Since then, cyberspace has changed
very much. Although there are many ways of using Shodan
maliciously, it is not appropriate to state that Shodan is still the
scariest search engine. There are several reasons for this. First
of all, Shodan has tried its best to limit the activity of malicious
users - there’s a limit on the number of searches a person
can do. Without registration, the limit is 10 searches, while
with an account, the limit rises to 50 [2]. If the user needs
more searches, they’ll need to buy one of Shodan’s premium
packets and state their intentions. Also, some filters (e.g. tags)
are unavailable unless the user buys the paid packets. The
purchase will reveal some information about the user, thus no
malicious actors will be using Shodan at its full capability.
Other than that, Shodan has many alternatives, such as
ZoomEye, Censys, or Criminal IP, which do not have strict
search limits.

Student2:
Shodan is a search engine that other than displaying websites, it reveals information about any device connected to the internet. According to Shodan, it is the first world’s search engine for internet-connected devices. At first sight, we might think that it is a very precious tool for hackers but in fact it is of no use as hackers use other more advanced tools to attack internet connected devices. Even though Shodan does not contribute much to the hacker’s world, it reveals how vulnerable IoT devices are and how anyone without deep knowledge can be able to gain access to a webcam, sensors or any device with minimal security. One of the most powerful functions of shodan is how it exposes the location of any device connected to the internet. This has caused big tech companies to consider taking extra measures to protect their IoT devices. There are various ways to achieve a higher level of security with the easiest one of them simply changing the default password that would make it challenging for hackers to gain access to these devices as it would be as hard as hacking a server.  Another way is by enabling multi-factor authentication with user’s IoT devices that would make it harder for hackers/ attackers to gain access without having access to the second authentication device.

Hackers can use shodan to hack into devices by simply searching for devices with default passwords and obtain their open ports. The hacker can then search the default password for that device and can then login the system and cause damage, steal information or control the device. Most Iot devices password is not changed from their default password which makes them much easier to hack. Gaining access to a huge number of IoT devices can also trigger the development of DDoS army of botnets by creating a malware targeted to infect these vulnerable IoT devices. And as shodan shows the vulnerabilities of these devices, a tailored malware can be developed easier as much information is gathered to determine the best vulnerability to access to infect the greatest number of devices.

On the other hand, shodan is an effective tool for defenders in many ways. Shodan can be used to discover devices with vulnerabilities or unnecessary open ports and fix this issue. Shodan is also used for research purposes as security specialists can use these tools along with their equipment to discover and rectify vulnerabilities. Moreover, it can be used to spread awareness to the public and show how vulnerable their unprotected devices are and the risks it imposes on their privacy and security.  There are various ways that could be used to increase the security of Iot devices that include setting a new password to these devices that would make it harder to break into. Companies should also be aware of these risks and ask their customers to change the password to use the device which would be critical to their privacy.  

Till this day Shodan remains the most popular search engine of its kind, however, competitors such as ZoomEye, and BinaryEdge are becoming more famous in the domain. But does shodan still stand as the “Scariest search engine on the internet”? I believe in terms of search engines, shodan would hold that title, as even if it is intended for good and ethical purposes it also has a very powerful negative side that can be used for crimes. Shodan might be created with good intentions for research purposes but turned out to be a very powerful tool for hackers, or perhaps script kiddies as serious hackers would have more advanced tools and methods to perform attacks. The fact that anyone with minimal computer knowledge can find locations of devices all over the world that ranges from smart fridges and home cameras to nuclear facility and industrial control systems is not the norm.


Student3:
According to the security survey, in 2021, 91% of industrial
organizations have encountered at least one incident related to
cyber security. As Eddy Wade, principal industrial
consultant at Dragos, a major cybersecurity firm in the Gulf
region says: “Keeping industrial control systems and operational
technology safe means protecting the most important structures
of an organization … Cyberattacks targeting critical industries
such as energy, oil, and gas, mining and pharmaceuticals will
leverage disruption of sometimes dangerous physical equipment
which we rely on as a society.” Formation and maintenance
of rigid and strong cyber security are vital to any industrial firm
nowadays, and it seems that its importance will only increase in
years to come.
As a tool, Shodan has both great advantages and
disadvantages in terms of its possible use cases and scenarios
that it can be incorporated into. Shodan can be used as a security
research and testing tool as it enables users to explore different
vulnerabilities in targeted devices and if used properly and in
goodwill, it can act as a highly beneficial tool for vulnerability
detection and cyber security maintenance. For instance, one
might check his own IP address via Shodan and see what
vulnerabilities are detected, or the Research and Development
team in an IoT firm might run multiple Shodan searches on the
devices that are in development to make alterations and/or
reinforce devices’ security. Naturally, the process can be
repeated, for instance, to make sure that the devices are not
prone to new vulnerabilities that have originated after the latest
firmware update and that there are no flaws left. Such a use case
opens a great possibility for IoT device manufacturers to test
their devices and facilitate research and development. In turn,
this will have economic benefits since expenses on R&D will
noticeably decrease. Having an extensive list of filters,
manufacturers and individual users can identify potential threats
to security and track exploits with the help of Shodan.
Conversely, Shodan can be used in malicious ways.
Individuals can look for under-protected devices and exploit the
vulnerabilities that those have. In the case of unprotected CCTV
cameras, they can use them to analyze security breaches or
weaknesses and access the premises of a secured object, facility,
private property, or any other place. In the case of ICS, they may
halt the ongoing processes resulting in production delays for
private companies (which will incur financial and reputational
losses), and the breakdown of critical infrastructure elements
which by itself creates numerous negative implications. They
may also disturb the ground and air traffic regulations if the
according systems are accessed, and this could certainly produce
devastating consequences (aircraft and automotive accidents).
Corporate networks can also get disrupted, which in turn would
cease normal workflow and communications within a firm or a
conglomerate if we are talking about an attack on a large-scale
entity. Logically, this would result in financial, reputational,
time, and many other losses for the stakeholder in question. It
can affect the stock prices of the company and its long-term
stability in the market.
While it may appear that Shodan is an all-powerful utility
that can tackle various devices, we believe that it is not as serious
as it may initially appear. While it provides some meaningful
assistance to attackers employing this tool, it primarily serves
the role of the detection device. It does not directly participate
in the orchestration of a malicious attack, but rather, provides a
solid informational foundation regarding the target that is to be
attacked. Relative to the exploits, botnets, cyber worms, and
many other cyber threats that have been covered so far, Shodan
does not present an immediate threat to the devices in question.
Furthermore, it is worth considering that Shodan is not
considered illegal, as it simply provides a way to scan ports of
the devices that are connected to the internet, unlike the after-
mentioned cyber threats and other tools that are available in
DarkWeb for instance. It is the unethical use case that makes it
seem like the source of the issue, however, one can use his or
her knowledge of chemistry to fabricate DIY explosives or to
synthesize aromatic compounds for fragrances. In both cases,
the freely available tools and knowledge can lead to different
end products, thus it is valid to say that it is the intent rather than
the tool that presents a danger.

GPT 1:
Shodan is a search engine that specializes in finding Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other connected systems that are connected to the internet. It allows users to search for specific types of devices and view information about them, including IP addresses, open ports, and software versions.
The use of Shodan can increase security and awareness among companies that design and sell IoT devices. By using Shodan, companies can discover any unsecured devices they have on the internet, and take steps to secure them. Additionally, Shodan can be used to monitor for vulnerabilities in devices, allowing companies to quickly patch them before they can be exploited.
However, Shodan can also be used by attackers to find potential targets for cyberattacks. Attackers can use Shodan to search for specific types of devices, such as industrial control systems, and then use the information gathered to launch targeted attacks. Additionally, attackers can use Shodan to find vulnerable devices and then use those devices as a foothold to launch attacks on other systems.
Shodan can also be used by defenders to identify and mitigate potential threats. Defenders can use Shodan to search for specific types of devices, such as industrial control systems, and then use the information gathered to identify and mitigate potential threats. Additionally, defenders can use Shodan to monitor for vulnerabilities in devices, allowing them to quickly patch them before they can be exploited.
In 2013, CNN referred to Shodan as "The scariest search engine on the Internet" due to the potential for abuse and the ease of finding critical infrastructure and other sensitive systems. However, whether it is true or not today is a matter of perspective. On one hand, Shodan has helped to raise awareness of the security issues surrounding IoT devices and connected systems, which can be a positive thing, but on the other hand, it also provides a tool for attackers to easily find vulnerable devices.
In conclusion, Shodan can be a powerful tool for both attackers and defenders, depending on how it is used. Companies that design and sell IoT devices can use Shodan to increase security and awareness, while attackers can use it to find vulnerable devices. It is important for companies to be aware of the risks and take steps to secure their devices, and for individuals to use Shodan responsibly.

GPT 2:
Shodan is a search engine that scans the internet for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and allows users to access information about their network configurations and open ports. The platform has been praised for increasing security and awareness among companies that design and sell IoT devices by allowing them to identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. However, the same information that makes Shodan useful for defenders can also be used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
One of the main ways that Shodan is increasing security and awareness among companies is by allowing them to identify vulnerabilities in their own devices. For example, a company may discover that a specific port on one of their devices is open and vulnerable to attack, which they can then fix. Additionally, Shodan can be used to identify if devices are using outdated software or firmware, which can be a major security risk. By identifying these vulnerabilities, companies can take steps to improve the security of their devices and better protect their customers.
However, the same information that is useful for defenders can also be used by attackers. For example, an attacker may use Shodan to identify vulnerable devices and then use that information to launch targeted attacks. Additionally, Shodan can be used to identify devices that are using default or easily guessable passwords, making it easier for attackers to gain access to them.
Despite the potential risks, Shodan can also be used by defenders to identify and mitigate potential threats. For example, a defender may use Shodan to identify devices that are vulnerable to a specific exploit and then take steps to patch or block that exploit. Additionally, Shodan can be used to identify devices that are likely to be controlled by a botnet, which can then be taken down or blocked.
In 2013, CNN referred to Shodan as “The scariest search engine on the Internet” due to its ability to identify vulnerable devices and the potential for those devices to be used in cyber attacks. However, whether or not this statement is still true today is debatable. While Shodan does have the potential to be used for malicious purposes, it can also be used for good by identifying vulnerabilities and helping companies improve the security of their devices.
Overall, it can be said that Shodan is both a tool for attackers and defenders. It can be used to identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors, but it can also be used to identify and mitigate potential threats. Whether or not Shodan is the “scariest search engine on the Internet” depends on how it is used. In the hands of a skilled defender, it can be a powerful tool for improving security. However, in the hands of an attacker, it can be a powerful tool for exploiting vulnerabilities.
GPT 3:
Shodan is a search engine that specializes in finding Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to the internet. It is considered a powerful tool for both attackers and defenders, as it can help identify vulnerabilities in IoT devices and network configurations.
On one hand, Shodan can increase security and awareness among companies that design and sell IoT devices. By using Shodan, companies can scan their own devices and networks to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as unpatched software or weak passwords. This can help companies take proactive measures to fix these issues before they are exploited by attackers. Additionally, by using Shodan to scan the devices of competitors, companies can gain insight into the security practices of their industry peers and improve their own products accordingly.
On the other hand, Shodan can also be used by attackers to identify vulnerable IoT devices and networks. Attackers can use Shodan to search for devices with known vulnerabilities, and then exploit those vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the devices and networks. This can lead to data breaches, network disruptions, and other security incidents.
To counter the potential risks posed by Shodan, companies and organizations can use the tool to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in their own devices and networks. For example, organizations can use Shodan to scan their networks for devices with weak passwords or unpatched software, and then take steps to fix those issues. Additionally, organizations can use Shodan to monitor their networks for unusual activity, such as new devices appearing on the network or devices communicating with known malicious IP addresses.
In 2013, CNN stated that "Shodan: The scariest search engine on the Internet." While it is true that Shodan can be used to identify vulnerable IoT devices and networks, it is also a powerful tool for identifying and mitigating those vulnerabilities. The tool can be used to increase security and awareness among companies that design and sell IoT devices, as well as to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in networks and devices.
Overall, I agree that Shodan is a powerful tool that can be used to identify vulnerabilities in IoT devices and networks. However, I also believe that the tool can be used to increase security and awareness among companies that design and sell IoT devices, as well as to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in networks and devices. It is important to note that the tool can be used by attackers and defenders alike, so organizations should be aware of the potential risks and take steps to mitigate them.


Question 9: This question discusses ethical and legal issues and policies for Shodan. Please describe, in 7-10 paragraphs, what are some ethical/legal issues that might arise while using Shodan?

Student1:
Shodan is a publicly available tool. Any vulnerable device
indexed by Shodan can be found by a malicious actor. As
we saw in the previous sections, the information found on
Shodan can be used to bring much harm not only to devices
but to human lives as well. This raises ethical and legal issues.
Should such a tool be available to everyone?
First of all, Shodan, after all, is a port scanner. In the US, for
example, port scanning is a legal activity. This is because
it is a tool that can be used both legally and illegally and both
ethically and unethically. For example, searching devices on
Shodan for research purposes is completely ethical and legal
- it has a good cause. However, establishing any unauthorized
access to the devices found on Shodan is unethical and illegal
in many countries. Therefore, as long as we stay in the
interface of Shodan and do not connect to the IP addresses
found there, we will be staying within the bounds of ethics.
There are several reasons why the use of Shodan should be
allowed:
1) As already discussed, Shodan has limitations against
users that may be malicious. These limitations make sure
that those users are unable to extensively use Shodan
without giving away their identities.
2) Although Shodan can be used maliciously, as already
discussed, it also allows the owners of the devices to
identify those vulnerabilities and fix them. Thus, it just
accelerates the process of fixing/exploiting vulnerabili-
ties. Even without Shodan and similar tools, the mali-
cious actors would still be able to find vulnerabilities
with tools such as Nmap. However, Shodan makes the
process much easier, which means that device owners
can better identify vulnerabilities in their devices. In
this sense, banning Shodan would just hide an issue in
security, not fix it.
3) Shodan offers a great way for researchers, penetration
testers, and security professionals to analyze the internet
and better protect it

Student2:
Shodan doesn’t just “port-scan” anymore, simply by searching for “webcams” you get hundreds of thousands of results with some of them displayed with a preview from the camera which raises ethical and legal concerns as people’s privacy is being violated. Moreover, deeper search results on specific devices reveal information that is not related to just port scanning, for example, if you search for “in-tank inventory” you get thousands of results of devices used in fuel pump stations with details about the fuel tanks, their temperature, water level, and more. Moreover, obtaining a screenshot of the login page of the organizations systems is not possible through port scanning which raises suspicions on possible different ways Shodan obtain its information. And displaying such detailed information is not really going to be useful for research purposes but would rather be of a great benefit to hackers or potential attackers.
All these details are displayed on the information page of that particular device that might oppose the main purpose of Shodan.


Student3:
While currently Shodan is not considered an illegal tool in
many countries, including the US, there are still many questions
and doubts regarding whether it is safe to allow such tools to
exist and be accessed by unidentified users freely. There are
various arguments that can be constructed, and we will cover
some of them.
One can argue that free access to information is a
fundamental right and since Shodan falls under the category of
an information source, it should be treated as any other source
and should not receive any unnecessary censorship. However,
hindering or restricting access to information may be justified
by governments that consider the information presented as a
threat to national security or the security of private firms and
other parties operating in the country.
At the same time, free access to information is beneficial too,
as it enables individuals and organizations to gain and deepen
their knowledge about the importance of cyber security.
Numerous contributions to the cyber security sphere that can
potentially be produced due to the use of Shodan-like tools
should not be disregarded, in spite of all the possible dangers
that come with it.


GPT 1:

Accessing these systems without permission could result in serious consequences, both for the individual and for the public at large.
Another ethical concern is the potential for misuse of Shodan. For example, an attacker could use Shodan to identify and target vulnerable systems, such as those that are not properly secured or are running outdated software. Additionally, criminals could use Shodan to find and access servers hosting sensitive information, such as personal data or financial information.
From a legal perspective, using Shodan to access systems or devices without permission could be considered unauthorized access or hacking. This is a criminal offense and could result in fines and/or imprisonment. Additionally, using Shodan to access critical infrastructure systems could be considered an act of terrorism, which carries even harsher penalties.
To mitigate these issues, it is important for users of Shodan to be aware of the ethical and legal implications of their actions. For example, users should only access systems or devices for which they have permission, and should not attempt to access systems that could cause harm or damage. Additionally, users should not attempt to access systems or devices that are considered critical infrastructure, such as power plants or water treatment facilities.
Furthermore, it is also important for users of Shodan to ensure they are following best practices for security. This includes keeping the software up-to-date, using strong passwords, and using encryption to protect sensitive information.
In conclusion, Shodan is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. It is important for users to be aware of the ethical and legal implications of their actions and to use the tool responsibly. Moreover, users should be aware of the potential for privacy violations and misuse and take steps to mitigate these risks. Additionally, users should be aware of the potential legal consequences of their actions and should not attempt to access systems or devices without permission.

GPT 2:
Shodan is a powerful search engine that allows users to search for internet-connected devices and networks, including servers, cameras, and industrial control systems. While this tool can be useful for cybersecurity professionals and researchers, it also raises several ethical and legal issues.
One issue is privacy. Shodan allows users to search for and access information about devices and networks that may be connected to sensitive or private information. This includes information about the location, configuration, and even live video feeds of devices such as security cameras. This access could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or surveillance.
Another issue is security. Shodan can also be used to search for vulnerabilities in internet-connected devices and networks. This can be useful for identifying and patching security vulnerabilities, but it can also be used by malicious actors to exploit those vulnerabilities. This could lead to data breaches, system shutdowns, or even physical damage.
A third issue is unauthorized access. Shodan allows users to search for and access devices and networks that they may not be authorized to access. This could include accessing devices and networks that are owned by other individuals or organizations. This unauthorized access could be considered illegal, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction in which the user is located.
A fourth issue is data ownership and control. Shodan allows users to access and collect information about devices and networks that may be owned by other individuals or organizations. This can raise questions about who owns and controls the data that is collected and how it can be used. This could potentially lead to disputes over data ownership and control.
A fifth issue is data breaches. Shodan can be used to search for and access devices and networks that may have been compromised. This could potentially lead to data breaches if the user is not careful. This is especially true if the user is not a cybersecurity professional and does not know how to properly handle the data that is collected.
A sixth issue is compliance. Shodan can be used to search for and access devices and networks that may be in violation of regulations and compliance laws. This could include devices and networks that are not compliant with data privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU.
In conclusion, while Shodan is a powerful tool that can be useful for cybersecurity professionals and researchers, it also raises several ethical and legal issues. These include privacy, security, unauthorized access, data ownership and control, data breaches, and compliance.

GPT 3:
Shodan is a search engine that allows users to find and access internet-connected devices, including security cameras, industrial control systems, and other types of IoT devices. While the tool can be used for legitimate purposes, such as vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, it can also be used for unethical or illegal activities. Therefore, it is important to consider the ethical and legal issues that may arise while using Shodan.
One ethical issue that may arise when using Shodan is the potential for privacy violations. Many of the devices indexed by Shodan, such as security cameras and home automation systems, may contain sensitive information about individuals. For example, a user may be able to access a live feed from a security camera installed in a private residence, potentially allowing them to view private activities of the occupants. Additionally, some devices may contain personal information, such as login credentials, that could be used for malicious purposes.
Another ethical issue related to Shodan is the potential for unauthorized access to critical systems. Many of the devices indexed by Shodan are part of industrial control systems or other critical infrastructure. Unauthorized access to these systems could potentially cause harm to individuals or disrupt important services. For example, a hacker could use Shodan to find and access a control system for a water treatment facility, potentially causing the release of contaminated water.
A legal issue that may arise when using Shodan is the violation of computer crime laws. Many countries have laws that prohibit unauthorized access to computer systems, and accessing devices through Shodan without permission could be considered a violation of these laws. Additionally, some countries have specific laws related to the unauthorized access of industrial control systems, which could also be violated by using Shodan.
Another legal issue related to Shodan is the violation of data protection laws. Many countries have laws that prohibit the collection, storage, and use of personal data without consent. By accessing devices through Shodan, a user may be able to collect sensitive personal information that could be used for malicious purposes. Additionally, some countries have laws that prohibit the distribution of personal data without consent, which could be violated by sharing information found through Shodan.
In addition to these issues, there may be specific legal and ethical considerations related to the use of Shodan in certain industries or for certain types of devices. For example, the healthcare industry may have strict regulations related to the protection of personal health information, and accessing medical devices through Shodan could be considered a violation of these regulations. Similarly, the financial industry may have strict regulations related to the protection of personal financial information, and accessing financial devices through Shodan could be considered a violation of these regulations.
To avoid these ethical and legal issues, it is important for users of Shodan to understand and comply with relevant laws and regulations. Additionally, users should consider the potential consequences of their actions before accessing devices through Shodan, and should only access devices for legitimate purposes. Users should also be aware of the potential for privacy violations, unauthorized access to critical systems, and other negative consequences when using the tool.
In conclusion, Shodan is a powerful tool that can be used for legitimate purposes, but it can also be used for unethical or illegal activities. Therefore, it is important to consider the ethical and legal issues that may arise when using the tool. Users should comply with relevant laws and regulations and should only access devices for legitimate purposes. Additionally, users should consider the potential consequences of their actions before accessing devices through Shodan.


Question 10: This question discusses policies for using Shodan. Imagine that you are a cybersecurity policy maker today, give 3 reasons why you would restrict or allow the use of Shodan? Write a policy, try to make it inclusive to cover other similar tools, that outlines the legality of the use of Shodan-like tools.

Student1:
A sample policy regarding the use of Shodan and similar
tools:
1) Purpose - To define the restrictions and requirements for
publicly available device-indexing search engines.
2) Scope - This policy applies to all search engines or tools
that are publicly available and index devices connected
to the internet. These will be mentioned as ”specified
tools” throughout the rest of the policy.
3) Exposing Critical Information - The specified tools
may expose some information that wasn’t meant to be
exposed to the public. Several regulations have to be
maintained to minimize the chance of this information
falling into the hands of malicious actors.
If the specified tool exposes such information:
• Each user of the specified tool must provide their
personal information in order to use the specified
tool with its full functionality.
• Only minimal functionality should be available for
the use of the tool without providing personal infor-
mation. These limitations include but are not limited
to:
– Limited number of searches
– Limited available filters
– Limited search results
These limitations may not apply if the tool offers only
general statistics rather than information about specific
devices.
4) Critical Infrastructures - the specified tool must hide the
devices that, if compromised, can bring harm to critical
infrastructures of the country. Refer to the country’s
legislature for the definition of critical infrastructures.
5) User Guidance - the website hosting the specified tool
must also provide a guide to a user on how to adequately
use the tool and how not to step outside the bounds of
ethics. The website must also discourage the user from
establishing a connection with devices found with the
specified tool.

Student2:
Shodan use should be restricted to its targeted market only. Even though hackers would use other tools to perform their hacks, private information should not be displayed out to the public “Legally” as done by Shodan. In my opinion, Shodan should only be used by research facilities and by security companies that would make optimal and legal use of the tool. Shodan should also not display detailed information and extracted data from vulnerable devices found when port-scanning. Even though shodan displays vulnerabilities of these devices based on their operating systems and software they use that can be found through other sources, displaying it to the public and especially hackers would make it easier for them to exploit those vulnerabilities hence if a version of Shodan is made to the public, it should not display the vulnerabilities of these devices. These policies should also be implemented on all Shodan-like search engines.


Student3:
Shodan is not entirely unique in the sense that there are other
similar scanning tools that exist freely on the internet. For a
government body, accounting for each and every tool individual
would be unreasonable and impractical. A uniform policy
regarding the scanning engines like Shodan that would cover all
the relevant aspects can be potentially introduced by
governments in order to define exact boundaries on what is
allowed and what is not.
Such a policy could cover various points, including
obligatory background checks for individuals/organizations
involved in the use of Shodan-like search engines. This could
eliminate the threat from certain parties wishing to employ the
tools in malicious ways, but it will happen at the expense of free
access to information, which is arguably one of the most crucial
rights existing nowadays. A more comprehensive approach
would be to clearly define the legality of different use scenarios
of Shodan-like tools. This could involve, for instance, the
implementation of user protocols that would only allow the use
cases that involve testing of one’s own devices and equipment,
and limit access to the devices beyond one’s own IP address.
Alternatively, governments can impose extensive security
requirements related to the available functionality and enabled
use cases to Shodan and other companies directly. This would
put the burden of complying with security standards on the
companies, which evidently will negatively impact them, but it
might in turn reduce the rate of criminal activity that involves
the use of Shodan-like tools and services.
